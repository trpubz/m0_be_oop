# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - self learning is great and required for coding
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - physcial pains are different than I used to, needing to figure out ergonmics a bit
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    - I learned about keyword args vs positional arguments
